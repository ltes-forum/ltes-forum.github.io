                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>As countries prepare their third round of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0) in 2025, effective coordination between energy, climate, and finance ministries has become essential. Long-term energy scenarios (LTES) provide the analytical foundation for climate strategies, but their impact depends on whether results are taken up in national decision-making processes.</p>
                <p>Alignment ensures consistency in assumptions (GDP growth, population, fuel prices), highlights synergies (energy access and emission reductions), and reveals trade-offs (e.g. fiscal impacts of fossil fuel subsidy reform). Importantly, LTES can quantify investment needs and provide indicative fiscal envelopes, creating entry points for finance ministries to integrate transition costs into annual and medium-term budgets.</p>
                <p>This session will examine institutional approaches for aligning LTES with NDCs, LT-LEDS, and financial planning. Presentations will set the scene with insights from Brazil (COP30 host), UNFCCC, and IRENA's new report on aligning LTES and LT-LEDS. Two panels will follow: one with countries sharing how they engage finance and environment ministries in scenario-driven planning, and one with international organizations reflecting on how to support countries in addressing bottlenecks and preparing NDC 3.0.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>To identify practical mechanisms that ensure LTES outputs are systematically aligned with NDCs, LT-LEDS, and budget processes, and to highlight lessons on cross-ministerial coordination that strengthen planning ecosystems and credibility of climate commitments.</p>

                <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Examples of mechanisms used by countries to integrate LTES into NDCs and LT-LEDS (e.g. inter-ministerial review, planning committees, budget hooks).</li>
                    <li>Lessons on how finance ministries can be engaged through scenario-based investment signals and fiscal envelopes.</li>
                    <li>Identification of common institutional barriers to alignment and how international partners can help address them.</li>
                    <li>Recommendations for how LTES can directly inform NDC 3.0 preparation in 2025.</li>

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Transmission and distribution networks are among the most cited bottlenecks to scaling renewables for the clean energy transition. Governments use LTES to map where and when new grid capacity will be needed, but investors need more than long-term projections: they require specific signals that reduce uncertainty i.e. which corridors will advance, what costs are expected, and how risks will be managed.</p>
                <p>The Global Coalition for Energy Planning (GCEP) consultation process identified three core investor needs that must be addressed to unlock private capital: speed (particularly in permitting and project approval), certainty (through long-term policy frameworks and clear regulatory signals), and bankability (via transparent risk allocation and revenue mechanisms). Grid infrastructure planning sits at the critical intersection between national energy scenarios and utility-level investment decisions‚Äîa gap that stakeholders identified as a major implementation barrier.</p>
                <p>A critical challenge in bridging this gap is translating the economic case for grid infrastructure, demonstrated through planning scenarios and cost-benefit analyses, into the investment case that financial actors require. While long-term energy scenarios establish the economic rationale for grid expansion, investors need this translated into specific financial models, risk-return profiles, revenue certainty, and bankable project structures.</p>
                <p>This session will explore how scenario-informed grid planning can generate these investor-relevant signals and how they are operationalized through institutional arrangements, risk allocation mechanisms, and financial instruments. It will examine which risks most constrain capital and how data transparency, coordination mechanisms, and innovative financing approaches are evolving to address them.</p>
                <p>The session will generate insights that inform the Global Coalition for Energy Planning's work on Planning to Investment. These outputs will also contribute to COP30 Action Agenda priorities under Axis 1 (Transitioning Energy, Industry and Transport), particularly the objectives of tripling renewables and mobilizing finance, and to cross-cutting enablers on climate finance and institutional strengthening.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>To identify how scenario-based grid planning can be translated into investor-relevant signals and risk allocation frameworks, and to distill practical lessons that inform GCEP recommendations on bridging the gap between economic cases and investment cases.</p>

                <h4>Expected Outcomes</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Practical lessons on how LTES-based grid planning can be translated into the financial metrics and signals that investors require.</li>
                    <li>Shared understanding of which risks most constrain private investment in grids, how perceived risks differ from actual risks, and which allocation mechanisms are proving effective.</li>
                    <li>Insights into institutional coordination mechanisms (between planning agencies, grid operators, and financial authorities) that help translate planning outputs into bankable projects.</li>
                    <li>Understanding of how data transparency and outcome measurement can reduce investor uncertainty and conservative capital allocation.</li>

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Scenarios are powerful tools for decision-making, but their value depends on how results are communicated and understood. Yet before communicating scenarios, it is essential to recognize that both scenario developers and their audiences bring biases, preconceptions, and priorities that shape how scenarios are created and received. Too often, scenario outputs remain confined to technical audiences, leaving untapped opportunities to build broader public and political support. Governments and institutions are finding that by first acknowledging different perspectives and priorities, then linking scenario insights to everyday concerns‚Äîhousehold costs, employment, reliability of supply‚Äîthey make scenarios more accessible and compelling.</p>
                <p>This session will begin by exploring how to surface and address the assumptions, biases, and priorities that scenario developers bring to their work, as well as the diverse preconceptions and concerns that different stakeholder groups hold about the energy transition. It will then focus on how countries and organizations have turned complex modelling results into narratives that resonate. It will highlight strategies for framing costs and benefits, emphasizing social and economic opportunities, and showing how scenarios anticipate and manage risks. It will also present IRENA's participatory planning toolkit, which provides practical methods for engaging diverse stakeholders in scenario processes and co-developing narratives that inspire action.</p>

                <p>Many governments face the challenge of sustaining modelling capacity: skilled staff move on, funding cycles are short, and tool deployment takes longer than policy timelines allow. While open-source tools can reduce costs and increase transparency, they require governance arrangements to ensure they are maintained and used consistently across ministries.</p>
                <p>This session will bring together country representatives and experts to share practical experiences of institutionalizing modelling tools in their planning processes. The emphasis will be on governance solutions, such as creating permanent modelling units, building inter-ministerial structures, or developing partnerships that sustain capacity. By exchanging lessons, participants will identify strategies for building sovereign, adaptive planning systems that can inform long-term energy scenarios.</p>
                <p>This roundtable will focus on how countries have embedded open-source and other modelling tools into their planning systems.

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Global supply chains for critical energy technologies‚Äîbatteries, solar modules, electrolyzers, wind turbines, and related components‚Äîare increasingly exposed to geopolitical risks, trade disputes, and market concentration. Disruptions or bottlenecks can delay deployment, raise costs, and undermine national transition strategies.</p>
                <p>Beneath these technology chains lies a deeper dependency on critical materials such as lithium, copper, nickel, and rare earth elements. While geological reserves are generally sufficient, refining and manufacturing are heavily concentrated in a few regions, and new capacity requires long lead times. These constraints make material supply a potential bottleneck for the speed of the transition rather than for energy security itself.</p>
                <p>Governments therefore need planning frameworks able to stress-test supply and technology pathways under different risk conditions. LTES processes can integrate supply-chain assumptions, assess timing mismatches, and explore strategic responses such as diversification of import sources, regional manufacturing, and circular-economy measures. Scenario results can also inform industrial and trade policies, investment prioritization, and regional cooperation strategies.</p>
                <p>The session will explore how scenario-based planning helps governments anticipate and manage supply-chain and critical-materials risks by embedding key assumptions into national transition pathways, stress-testing vulnerabilities, and identifying credible backup options. It will highlight how scenario results can inform industrial, trade, and investment policies, improve coordination across ministries, and support clear communication of resilience and cost trade-offs to decision-makers and the public.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>To explore how long-term energy scenarios (LTES) can anticipate supply-chain and critical-materials risks and to translate these insights into policy choices on diversification, domestic capability, and regional cooperation.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Practical lessons on incorporating supply chain risks into scenario frameworks.</li>

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Digitalization is becoming a structural driver of electricity demand. Data centers, AI computing clusters, and digital industrial hubs are expanding rapidly, often with concentrated siting and steep load profiles. If not anticipated, these loads risk creating bottlenecks for grids and delaying renewable integration.</p>
                <p>LTES processes provide governments with a way to bring digitalization into national energy planning. By capturing demand signals from industrial policy, technology adoption, and market forecasts, scenarios can stress-test system adequacy and identify investment needs well before demand surges materialize. This ensures that grid expansion, flexibility options, and siting decisions are prepared in advance, avoiding delays and cost escalation.</p>
                <p>This session will bring together experiences from countries and research institutions that have begun incorporating digitalization trends into their planning. The discussion will focus on what data and institutional processes are needed, what planning and governance measures are effective, and how scenario frameworks can keep pace with rapidly evolving digital sectors.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>To explore how national LTES can anticipate and integrate digitalization-driven demand growth, enabling early infrastructure planning and aligning digital expansion with system decarbonization.</p>

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly present and influencing energy modelling and planning workflows. Research institutions and international organizations have tested and piloted applications ranging from grid optimization to AI-enhanced geospatial data, automated scenario analysis, and AI bots for training and capacity building. These pilots show AI potential to accelerate analysis and broaden scenario exploration, but they also expose challenges of trust, validation, data privacy, data quality, and explainability.</p>
                <p>For governments, the key question is not whether AI has potential, but what institutional conditions must exist to make adoption feasible, responsible, and aligned with national planning mandates. Different AI applications‚Äîfrom real-time grid operations to long-term scenario analysis‚Äîrequire different governance approaches, data standards, and validation practices. This session will focus on translating lessons from early pilots into actionable insights for governments: what institutional mandates, procurement rules, data policies, cross-ministerial coordination mechanisms, and validation practices would be needed to adopt AI responsibly and sustainably.</p>

                <h4>Context</h4>
                <p>The Global LTES Network has consistently highlighted the role of scenarios as decision-support tools for governments navigating complex transitions. In many countries, just transition has emerged as a political and economic imperative; requiring policy packages that address labor market shifts, regional economic impacts, and social protection. Recent UNFCCC Just Transition Work Programme dialogues, including the fourth dialogue in Addis Ababa, stressed that transition pathways must be nationally defined, equity-based, and fiscally viable, with active participation of workers, communities, and vulnerable groups.</p>
                <p>This session will focus on how scenario frameworks can serve as anticipatory governance tools to operationalize these priorities. By embedding socioeconomic and equity dimensions in long-term planning, LTES approaches can help governments identify impacts before they materialize, quantify fiscal needs, and design policy measures that maintain support across political cycles. The discussion will link national scenario practice to broader just transition processes under the UNFCCC and provide inputs for the Global Coalition for Energy Planning (GCEP), which seeks to bridge planning with finance and inclusion.</p>

                <h4>Objective</h4>
                <p>To explore how long-term energy scenarios can be applied to design just transition strategies that are aligned with national development priorities, anticipate socioeconomic impacts, and support equitable and fiscally sustainable transitions.</p>
